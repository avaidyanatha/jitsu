# Deploying Jitsu

[**Jitsu**](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) â€” is an open-source data collection platform. We built
our platform incredibly easy to deploy and use. Below, we have several step-by-step guides outlining
how to set up Jitsu on a variety of different environments  with the easiest being [**Heroku deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku) and [**Docker deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker). For deploying
on Kubernetes, check out [**Plural deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-plural).
